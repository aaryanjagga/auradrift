Aura Drift 

A classic arcade experience evolved for the modern web. Aura Drift is a fully responsive, browser-based game built entirely with the "Trio" of web technologies: HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript.

No libraries. No frameworks. Just pure logic.

🚀 Live Features

Multi-Level Progression: Battle through 3 standard levels of increasing speed and difficulty, culminating in the high-stakes Master Level.

Smart Ghost AI: Unlike basic random-movement clones, each ghost has a unique personality and targeting logic:

🔴 Blinky (Red): Directly chases Pac-Man.

🌸 Pinky (Pink): Attempts to ambush by targeting 4 tiles ahead of Pac-Man.

🔹 Inky (Cyan): Uses complex positioning relative to Blinky to trap the player.

🔸 Clyde (Orange): Chases when far away but retreats to his corner when close.

Power Mechanic: Eat the green Power Pellets to turn the tables for 9 seconds.

Ghosts turn blue and become vulnerable.

Vulnerable ghosts flash white when the power window is about to expire.

Eaten ghosts respawn immediately in the central house.

Fully Responsive: The game board scales dynamically to fit any screen size (Mobile, Tablet, or Desktop).

Universal Controls:

Desktop: Use Arrow Keys to navigate.

Mobile: Native swipe gesture support. Swipe anywhere on the screen to change direction.

🕹️ How to Play

Objective: Eat all the pellets in the maze to clear the level.

Avoid Ghosts: You start with 3 lives. Touching a ghost in its normal state will cost you a life.

Master Level: Complete Level 3 to reach the Master Level, where ghosts move with peak efficiency and speed.
